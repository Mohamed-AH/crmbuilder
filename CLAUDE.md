# CRM Builder — working notes

Context for anyone (human or agent) picking this up mid-stream. Read this
before changing code; it records decisions and traps that are not obvious from
the source, and it is the safe restart point after a context compaction.

**Branch:** `claude/pwa-modular-crm-builder-xcwgzv` — all work goes here.
**Live:** https://crmbuilder-v1.onrender.com

## 1. What this is

A modular CRM for small businesses. Offline-first installable PWA, plus a small
Express backend for Google OAuth sign-in, workspace sync to MongoDB, and admin.
No build step, no frontend framework — plain ES5-ish scripts loaded in order by
`index.html`.

```
server.js             Express: static PWA, OAuth, /api/data sync, /api/admin/*, /api/org
index.html            app shell (script order matters — see §3)
css/style.css         Inter + blue/slate palette, light/dark, desktop-first
js/icons.js           inline Lucide SVGs (generated — see §6)
js/db.js              IndexedDB wrapper
js/csv.js             RFC 4180 CSV reader/writer
js/templates.js       prebuilt module templates
js/demo-data.js       fictional business (generated — see §6)
js/tour.js            guided walkthrough engine (no dependencies)
js/cloud.js           account + sync layer, server ⇄ local fallback
js/app.js             router, all views, module builder, kanban, admin, tour steps
sw.js                 service worker (BUMP CACHE_VERSION on any asset change)
tests/                smoke, API contract, CSV unit, Playwright E2E
docs/                 user guide, onboarding playbook, demo script, architecture
```

---

## 2. Current status

**All green:** 48 Node tests + 38 Playwright tests.

```sh
npm install
npm test                # everything
npm run test:api        # spawns its own server on a random port
npm run test:e2e        # Playwright boots its own server
npm run test:smoke      # deployment audit, localhost
BASE_URL=https://crmbuilder-v1.onrender.com npm run test:smoke   # audit live
```

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs everything on push and smoke-tests the
live URL (defaults to crmbuilder-v1; override with the `LIVE_URL` repo variable).

### Shipped
- Modules/fields/records, table + kanban views, type-aware column sorting
- CSV import (column mapping, inline field creation, type coercion) and export
- Google OAuth, workspace sync (last-write-wins), full offline operation
- Admin dashboard with analytics; **organisations with per-tenant scoping**
- One-click demo business (107 records) and a 6-step guided tour
- Docs: USER-GUIDE, ONBOARDING, DEMO-SCRIPT, ARCHITECTURE, product-tour.html

### Not built yet
- **Shared team workspaces** — an org groups people for *administration* only;
  each account still has its own workspace. See §5.
- **Per-record sync** — this is the gate on shared workspaces.
- Invites/join-an-org flow, email sending, third-party integrations.

## 3. Invariants — do not break these

**The UI must paint before any network call resolves.** `init()` in `js/app.js`
calls `route()` and only then `syncInBackground()`. Free-tier hosts sleep and can
take a minute to answer; a returning user once saw a bare shell because a stalled
await ran before `route()`. Guarded by the test *"paints immediately even when the
server is asleep"* (hangs `/api/me` for 8s, requires paint under 5s).

**No single failure may leave the app unrendered.** `init()` binds chrome first,
wraps data loading in try/catch, runs a 2.5s watchdog, and has a final `.catch`.
`route()` guards sidebar and view separately. `DB.open()` always settles
(timeout + `onblocked`). Two tests break IndexedDB outright and require the app
to render *and still navigate*.

**Every `Cloud` API call carries an `AbortSignal.timeout`.** Nothing may hang.

**Script order in `index.html` matters.** `js/app.js` last; it references
`DEMO_DATA`, `Tour`, `CSV`, `LUCIDE`, `TEMPLATES`, `DB`, `Cloud` as globals.
Adding a file means updating both `index.html` *and* `sw.js` APP_SHELL, and
bumping `CACHE_VERSION` (currently `crmbuilder-v4`).

**Tenancy scoping comes from the session, never a request.** See §5.

**Only `http/https/mailto/tel` may reach an `href`** (`safeHref` in app.js) —
record values arrive from CSV imports and shared backups.

**`openRecord` and `openCSVImport` re-resolve their module** via `getModule(id)`.
Rendered rows can outlive the module definition they were drawn from.

---

## 4. Traps that have already cost time

**CSS cascade.** `.input` declares the `padding` shorthand and sits *later* in
the file than `.search-input`; a bare `.search-input { padding-left }` loses and
the placeholder lands on the search icon. Use a more specific selector.

**Grid auto-placement in the module builder.** `.builder-field` is **flex, not
grid**, deliberately. With grid, revealing the dropdown-options input
(`grid-column: 2/-1`) pushed the trailing controls into columns sized for row 1,
squashing "Req" to 16px so its label painted over "List". Don't reintroduce grid.

**MongoDB TTL indexes are single-field only.** `expireAfterSeconds` on a compound
key like `{ orgId, at }` is accepted *without error* and then ignored — nothing
ever expires. `{ at: 1 }` does expiry; `{ orgId: 1, at: 1 }` serves queries.

**MongoDB refuses to change an index's options in place** (error 85/86).
`ensureEventTTL()` catches that, drops and recreates. Needed because live
deployments already have a plain `{ at: 1 }`.

**Email is globally unique, not per-org.** Sign-in resolves an account from an
email alone with no org in hand, so `{ orgId, email }` unique would make login
non-deterministic.

**Renaming a field keeps its key.** Labels are display-only, so record data
survives a rename — the default builder field stays `#f-name` after relabelling.

**Async re-render races in tests.** `renderModuleBodyOnly` is async and click
handlers don't await it. Wait on rendered state (`aria-sort`, a row appearing)
before reading the DOM, or you sample the *previous* render and the assertion
passes for the wrong reason.

**Row clicks land on links.** Email/phone/URL cells are anchors that stop
propagation. Click `tr td:first-child` to open a record.

**Template cards** wrap a visually hidden checkbox — `.check()` fails; click the
card. **Hidden-but-present elements** (`#topbar` on desktop, `#import-csv-file`)
must not be `waitForSelector`ed.

**Killing the dev server:** `pkill -f "[s]erver\.js"` in a **separate** Bash
call. A compound command mentioning `server.js` matches itself.

## 5. Organisations and tenancy (shipped)

```
orgs   { id, name, createdAt, createdBy }
users  { id, email, name, orgId, role, disabled, createdAt, lastActiveAt }
data   { userId, orgId, modules[], records[], settings, ... }
events { type, userId, orgId, day, at }
```

Roles: `platformAdmin` (operates the deployment, crosses orgs) · `owner`
(administers their own org only) · `member`.

- Every signup creates an org and owns it. `ADMIN_EMAILS` and the first-ever
  account become `platformAdmin`.
- `requireOrgAdmin` sets `req.scopeOrgId` **from the session**. `requirePlatformAdmin`
  is a *separate* middleware — never a branch inside the org check, because the
  conditional form gets copied into a handler with the precedence wrong.
- Cross-org access returns **404, not 403**, so responses don't confirm existence.
- An `owner` cannot grant `platformAdmin`.
- `migrateToOrgs()` runs on boot, is idempotent, and puts each pre-orgs account
  in its own org (`admin`→`platformAdmin`, `user`→`owner`).
- **Eight isolation tests in `tests/api.test.mjs` assert the attack**, not the
  happy path. Keep them passing; they are the gate on this area.

**Why workspaces are still per-account:** whole-document sync is last-write-wins.
Putting colleagues on one shared workspace before per-record sync would silently
discard each other's edits. Per-record sync is the prerequisite — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.2 and §7.

---

## 6. Generated files — do not hand-edit

- **`js/icons.js`** — from the `lucide-static` npm package. Extract the **inner**
  content of each `<svg>`; the files open with a license comment, and a naive
  first-`>` regex nests svgs and swallows trailing button text.
- **`js/demo-data.js`** — from a Python generator. Dates are stored as
  `{ __rel: days }` and resolved at load time so the data never looks stale.

---

## 7. The guided tour (`js/tour.js`)

Pre-flights before showing anything: `ensureReady()` must return `{ ok: true }`,
and every step's route must resolve. Steps whose screen can't exist are dropped
so "Step N of M" stays true. If data can't be prepared the tour **doesn't start**
and says why.

This was flaky and the cause is worth remembering: when `demo-data.js` failed to
load, `dealsId()` returned `undefined`, routes became `#/m/undefined`, navigation
was silently skipped, and `waitFor` burned a 6s timeout per step — steps 2–4
narrated over the onboarding screen while the app appeared frozen. Fixed by
pre-flight + `goto` returning `false` + a 2s target budget.

Steps 2 and 3 set up their own screen (`before` hooks force board / sorted table)
rather than assuming inherited view state.

---

## 8. Known gaps and honest limits

- **Sync is whole-snapshot last-write-wins.** A 5,000-record workspace uploads
  1.28 MB per edit; degradation is a latency problem long before the 16 MB
  MongoDB document ceiling (~62,000 records, where saves fail outright).
- **Free-tier cold starts.** The app paints instantly regardless, but sign-in and
  sync wait for the server. Warm the URL before a demo.
- **This session cannot reach `*.onrender.com`** — the egress proxy returns 403.
  Live verification must be run by the user or by CI. A uniform all-checks-failed
  result in the smoke test is reported as a probable network block, not a broken
  deployment.

---

## 9. Conventions

- Commit messages: what changed and *why*, including traps discovered.
- Every bug fix gets a regression test, and the test is checked against the
  broken state — a test that passes on the bug is worthless.
- Prefer measuring over asserting: sizes, timings and layout are checked by
  driving the real app, not by reasoning about the code.
